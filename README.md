# Python-Markov-Chain-Sentence-Creator
This notebook generates sentences using a Markov chain stochastic model. The input of this model takes a user-defined vocabulary word and creates a list of sentences composed of synonyms of the input word. The synonyms are extracted using the Natural Language Toolkit module and a vocabulary API is leveraged to collect the sentences.

The structure of this notebook can be divided into four sections:
- User defined vocabulary word input, used to generate synonyms via the Natural Language Toolkit module
- Example sentences of each synonym are extracted from an API 
- Function created for the Markov chain model 
- Sentence generation

I hope to improve this model over time by refining the data inputs for the model, and eventually look to include this script as a module in my [Vocabulary Flashcard Web-Application](https://github.com/eli64s/Django-Flashcard-Web-App). Feel free to ask questions and suggest areas of improvement!
