# Python-Markov-Chain-Sentence-Creator
A Jupyter Notebook that generates sentences using a Markov chain stochastic model. The input of this model uses a list vocabulary synonyms and a string of each word used in an example sentence. 

The example input used in this notebook is included below, with the vocabulary synonyms in bold:
- He was **upbraided** for his slovenly appearance
- She **chastised** his colleagues for their laziness
- His mother came out and **berated** me for raising my voice
- She had **rebuked** him for drinking too much
- Mom took Anna away, **scolding** her for her bad behavior
- He was **reproved** for obscenity
- His wife **reproached** him with cowardice
- They **lambasted** the report as a gross distortion of the truth
- A judge was **censured** in 1983 for a variety of types of injudicious conduct
- The papers that had been **excoriating** him were now lauding him
- She **admonished** me for appearing at breakfast unshaven

This notebook is fairy straightforward and there are many oppurtunities to enhance this model for more accuracy. My end goal is to implement this as a feature in my Flashcard web-application [project](https://github.com/eli64s/Django-Flashcard-Web-App). Feel free to ask questions and suggest areas of improvement!
